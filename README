Purpose: To demonstrate, using a couple of builtin features of chialisp, 
that it's possible to short-range "teleport"(blink) value and thereby enhance money privacy.

Technique: Leveraging how in chialisp wallet addresses are also puzzle hashes and puzzle hashes are also logic.
And how if there is unassigned coin value in a spend_bundle in excess of a deficit value in the same bundle then the coin having a deficit successfully spends.
We enlist a faucet to pay coin A to a wallet address with logic to pay a higher amount than it is worth(has a deficit value) into an anonymous wallet. 
The deficit value of coin A is the same value as coin C which needs privacy.
This particular transaction is verifiably successful as per the files herein 
and I assert there is no way to prove that the deficit value coin A overcame did or did not come from coin C, coin B or a combination of them.  

NOTE: This technique is completely insecure and error prone(AKA you will lose you money), but rather designed to foster discussion. 
Please feel free to attempt to prove my assertion wrong.
